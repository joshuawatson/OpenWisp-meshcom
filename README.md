(ToDo)
Users registration's new features:

- add both residential and business user fields; fields must be mandatory

- formal check of the tax code, VAT number and the IBAN (online)

- add a scrolling menu field in users registration page with the available products; add a page "products" to insert new product codes

- users cpe's configuration files creation; (partly implemented, add chance to upload more config templates)

- production of the user's application form; at the end of the registration process we need to produce the application form (contract) for the user's acceptance and subscription of the privacy conditions, payment method and delivery conditions (partly implemented, there are some typos in the contract)

- operators division for calculating rewards (add operator code field); each operator can manage (and see) only his own clients and the superadmin can manage (and see) all clients
